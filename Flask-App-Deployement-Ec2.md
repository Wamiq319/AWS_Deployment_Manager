 Step 1: Create an EC2 Instance
 1. Log in to AWS Management Console and launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu.
 2. Configure security groups: HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), and SSH (port 22).
 3. Download the SSH key pair (your_key_pair.pem).

 Step 2: Test Flask App Locally
1. Navigate to your Flask app directory and test it locally:
2. Clean Up (optional):
3Remove virtual environment folder and unnecessary dependencies if any:
4. Generate requirements.txt
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


Step 3: Connect to EC2 via SSH
Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:
```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/AWS/your_key_pair.pem ubuntu@your_ec2_public_ip
```
Update the server:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
Exit the SSH session:
exit

Step 4: Transfer Flask App to EC2 Instance
1Create an 'AWS' folder in your Downloads directory and move your Flask app and .pem SSH key into it:
2Use SCP to copy your Flask app to the EC2 instance:
```bash
scp -i ~/Downloads/AWS/your_key_pair.pem -r ~/Downloads/AWS/flask-app ubuntu@your_ec2_public_ip:/home/ubuntu/
e.g scp -i flask-app.pem -r aws ubuntu@ec2-3-7-185-177.ap-south.compute.amazonaws.com:/ubuntu/home/Flask-app
```
Step 6: Set Up Flask App on EC2
1 SSH back into your EC2 instance:
```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/AWS/your_key_pair.pem ubuntu@your_ec2_public_ip
```
2 Navigate to the Flask app directory:
```bash
cd flask-app
```
 Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
 Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies from requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run  and test the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
curl http://your_ec2_public_ip:5000
e.g http://2-3-7-185-177:5000
```
Press ctrl+ c to quit the app 
#MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN VIRTUAL ENVIROMENT YOU CAN ALSO INSTALL THESE IN UBUNTU MACHINE
Step7:Run Gunicorn WSGI server to serve the Flask Application
When you ‚Äúrun‚Äù flask, you are actually running Werkzeug‚Äôs development WSGI server, which forward requests from a web server.
Since Werkzeug is only for development, we have to use Gunicorn, which is a production-ready WSGI server, to serve our application.

Install Gunicorn using the below command:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```
Run Gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app 
```
Gunicorn is running (Ctrl + C to exit gunicorn)!

Use systemd to manage Gunicorn
Systemd is a boot manager for Linux. We are using it to restart gunicorn if the EC2 restarts or reboots for some reason.
We create a <projectname>.service file in the /etc/systemd/system folder, and specify what would happen to gunicorn when the system reboots.
We will be adding 3 parts to systemd Unit file ‚Äî Unit, Service, Install

Unit ‚Äî This section is for description about the project and some dependencies
Service ‚Äî To specify user/group we want to run this service after. Also some information about the executables and the commands.
Install ‚Äî tells systemd at which moment during boot process this service should start.
With that said, create an unit file in the /etc/systemd/system directory
	
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/FLASK-APP.service
```
Then add this into the file.
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance for a simple flask app
After=network.target
[Service]
User=ubuntu
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/Flask-app(in hwhich you have app.py and other files )
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/Flask-app/venv/bin/gunicorn -b localhost:8000 app:app
Restart=always
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Then enable the service:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start FLASK-APP
sudo systemctl enable FLASK-APP
```
Check if the app is running with 
```bash
curl localhost:8000
```
#step8:Run Nginx Webserver to accept and route request to Gunicorn
Finally, we set up Nginx as a reverse-proxy to accept the requests from the user and route it to gunicorn.

Install Nginx 
```bash
sudo apt-get nginx
```
Start the Nginx service and go to the Public IP address of your EC2 on the browser to see the default nginx landing page
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```
Edit the default file in the sites-available folder.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
Add the following code at the top of the file (below the default comments)
```bash
upstream flask-app-server {
    server 127.0.0.1:8000;
}
```
Add a proxy_pass to flaskhelloworld atlocation /
```bash
location / {
    proxy_pass http://flask-app-server;(Same Name as name set for upstream)
}
```
Restart Nginx 
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
Tada! üéâ Our application is up! üöÄ
